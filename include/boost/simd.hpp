      Boost.SIMD provides a set of types to handle SIMD operations in a portable way.
      Those types include:

      - boost::simd::pack which encapsulates SIMD registers
      - boost::simd::logical which encapsulates typed boolean values

    /*!
      @ingroup group-api
      @defgroup group-functions Functions and Constants

      Boost.SIMD functions and constants are designed to work seamlessly on both scalar
      and SIMD parameters. Their compile-time polymorphic behavior ensures that the best
      available implementation will be selected for any given combination of types, architecture
      and options (if any).

      While being documented as functions, most Boost.SIMD functions are actually Function Objects.
      This implementation allow Boost.SIMD to use its functions directly in standard algorithms
      and to support functions decorators to handle variations in functions' behavior.

      Boost.SIMD functions are accessible via the header files located in the
      @c boost/simd/function folder. E.g, boost::simd::abs requires the inclusion
      of boost/simd/function/abs.hpp.

      Similarly, Boost.SIMD constants are accessible via the header files located in the
      @c boost/simd/constant folder. E.g, boost::simd::True requires the inclusion
      of boost/simd/constant/true.hpp. All Boost.SIMD functions begin with a lower-case
      letter and all Boost.SIMD constants begin with an upper-case letter.

      Function semantics are usually similar to the pre-existing ones, if any, with the
      following caveats:

      - All functions are assumed to be @c noexcept.
      - Type mixing may be prohibited for fundamental types , i.e boost::simd::plus @c (char,char)
        is valid while boost::simd::plus @c (int,char) is not
      - Type promotion on result type may be disabled, i.e boost::simd::plus @c (char,char)
        returns @c char

      These limitations are due to the hardware implementation of these functions.
